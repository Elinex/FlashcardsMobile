### Overview

The main idea of the app is to create decks with flashcards to improve your studies.

It can be added as many cards as wished.

When the quiz is ended, a score is rendered to check your progress!

### Instructions to install

Execute __yarn install__ and then __yarn start__ inside the __FlashCardsMobile__'s directory to initialize the app. If you prefer, can be used npm rather than yarn.
