The project __FlashCardsMobile__ app makes part of [project 3](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1215/view) from React Udacity ND.

The app was build to work in ios and android devices.

Execute __yarn install__ and then __yarn start__ inside the __FlashCardsMobile__'s directory to initialize the app. If you prefer, can be used npm rather than yarn.

The main idea of the app is to create decks with flashcards to improve your studies.

It can be added as many cards as wished.

When the quiz is ended, a score is rendered to check your progress!
